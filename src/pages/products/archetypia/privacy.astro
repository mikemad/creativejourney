              <p>
                Archetypia is designed with privacy in mind. All personality assessment data and results

              <p>
                The App does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.
                We do not share your information with third parties because we do not collect it.

              <p>

              <p>
                Since all data is stored locally on your device, the security of your data depends on
                the security measures you have in place on your device (such as passcode protection,

                the App from your device.
